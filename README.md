#Introduction

This file is helpful in order to understand the Run_analysis code. The 5 requeriments are done as follow:
1, 2, 4, 3, 5.

An overview in the txt files was done. dim() and unique() were used in order to understand the files.
X_test.txt and X_train.txt were open by read.table() instead of fread().

To merge the X_test.txt and X_train.txt files, I used the rbind().
The features.txt file contains the names of the columns for  X_test and X_train tables.
